                <p class="para-headings-big bruh">What Is Machine Learning?</p>

                <p class="para-one bruh">Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building
                    computer systems that learn from data.
                    Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data.</p>

                <p class="para-two bruh"> Today, companies are using Machine Learning to improve business decisions, increase
                    productivity, detect disease, forecast weather, and do many more things.</p>

                <p class="para-three bruh"> Now, let's take a peek at some cool stuff ML can do:
                </p>

                <div class="para-headings bruh">1. Image Recognition</div>
                <div class="para bruh">Ever heard of machines recognizing objects in pictures? It's like magic! ML helps
                    computers identify things in digital images. Think of your smartphone recognizing your face or a
                    camera spotting a cat.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="para one-before">
                    ML can understand what we say! When you talk to devices like Alexa or Siri, they use ML to figure
                    out your words and respond. It's like having a chat with a robot buddy.

                </div>
                <div class="para one-one">

                    Have you ever wondered how Google Maps knows the fastest route? It collects data about traffic from
                    all around, crunches the numbers with ML, and poof! It predicts traffic and guides you on the
                    quickest path.

                <div class="para-headings two">

                <div class="para two-two">
                    You know when websites suggest things you might like? That's ML too! It watches what you buy, look
                    at, and put in your cart to recommend products you'll love.

                </div>

                <div class="para two-two">
                    Yes, self-driving cars use ML too! They use it to understand their surroundings, like a robot driver
                    that learns from its cameras and sensors.

                </div>

                <div class="para-headings one-one">

                <div class="para one">
                    Hate getting spam emails? ML helps your email filter out the junk. It's like having a superhero
                    guarding your inbox!

                <p class="last-para para">In medical science, machine learning is used for diseases diagnoses. With this,
                    medical technology is growing very fast and able to build 3D models that can predict the exact
